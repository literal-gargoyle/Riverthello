## üéÆ How to Play

### Basic Rules

1. **Game Setup:**
   - The game is played on an 8√ó8 board with 64 squares
   - It starts with 4 discs placed in the center (2 black, 2 white placed diagonally)
   - Black makes the first move

2. **Making Moves:**
   - Players take turns placing one disc of their color on an empty square
   - Each move must "outflank" at least one opponent disc
   - Outflanking means placing a disc so that one or more of your opponent's discs are between your newly placed disc and another one of your existing discs (in a straight line)
   - All outflanked discs are flipped to your color

3. **Game End:**
   - The game ends when neither player can make a legal move
   - The player with the most discs of their color on the board wins
   - If both players have the same number of discs, the game is a draw

### Strategy Tips

- **Corners are King:** Try to secure the corner squares as they can never be flipped
- **Avoid X-Squares:** The squares diagonally adjacent to corners often give your opponent access to corners
- **Mobility Over Quantity:** Having more possible moves is often better than having more discs on the board
- **Edge Control:** Build stable formations along the edges of the board
- **Think Ahead:** Consider not just your next move, but what moves it sets up for both players

## üèÜ Rating System

Riverthello uses an ELO-based rating system:
- All players start with a rating of 1200
- Winning against higher-rated players earns more points
- Losing against lower-rated players costs more points
- Rating determines your rank tier:
  - Master (2000+)
  - Expert (1800-1999)
  - Skilled (1600-1799)
  - Intermediate (1400-1599)
  - Beginner (below 1400)
